When implementing collaboration with the recommendation systems, the model considers rating from a various amount of users. It takes into account that ratings have been given by a user for specific episodes they have watched. 

The model filters by using Jaccard Similarity, measuring the similarity between two given sets. It merges the viewing histories of group members into a single user profile. It then generates recommendations based on similar ranges of other users. 

From a mathematical standpoint, the Jaccard Similarity can be represented by the equation and set operators: 

JaccardSim(A,B)= ∣A∪B∣ / ∣A∩B∣

where ∣A∪B∣ denotes the absolute value (number of values) of the union of the two sets
and ∣A∩B∣ denotes the absolute value (number of values) of the intersection of the two sets


Here it calculates the similarity between the set of 'showId' values of that user and the 'group_movies' set.

If the similarity between users falls below a threshold of 0.1 and is not 0, the model identifies the symmetric difference between the sets and includes them in a set named 'new_content'.
It restricts the number of similar users taken into account to 15.

Here we are left with the data frame 'df_recommendation' that holds these unique recommendations.
