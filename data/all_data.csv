Reggie also meets the non-Russians who live in fear of persecution and hears horrific stories of those who have survived vicious racist attacks. And with the rise of the far right not just in Russia but across many other western countries, including the UK, Reggie asks if this is what can happen when you love your country too much."

Bashar al-Assad trained to be an eye doctor at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and Asma was a British-born girl from a Syrian family with a career in investment banking. Over a decade ago, they were being welcomed with open arms in Britain. Today, they are entrenched in a brutal war that has led to some of the most horrifying crimes of modern times. Told through rarely seen footage and testimony of those who knew them, worked with them and studied them, the series explores how the couple, who at first were seen as a modernising force, ended up running a regime accused of war crimes.In episode two, Bashar Assad is now president of Syria. His glamorous wife Asma is now first lady. Both are faced with a number of problems. Asma's in-laws don't like the idea of her being first lady and want to keep her out of the limelight.

They grapple with tough, unsettling and emotional questions about being black and British in search of a way forward. Each of them has a deeply personal story to share about an event that proved to be a seismic moment in their life. They confront their differences, hoping to find answers from each other and from those who are trying to change Britain.The most radical of the group, university professor Kehinde, set up Britain's first black studies degree. He believes it's time for a fundamental change to Britain. He has a revolutionary idea to reveal to the group which could prove divisive - black-only workplaces. Although recent years have seen black leaders taking the top jobs at some big companies, at the latest count, there wasn't a single black CEO in a FTSE 100 company. At the other end of the pay scale, however, black people are overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. The group meet someone who won one of the UK's biggest race discrimination payouts in recent years and debate whether taking companies to task or race-based quotas could be the way forward. One of the panel from last year's controversial race commission report also drops in to discuss whether or not racism is still the most significant barrier holding back progression for black people in Britain.29-year-old NHS doctor Raphel has matters of the heart on his mind.  He's at a stage in life where he's looking to settle down and feeling the pressure to marry within the black community, so he wants to ask the group whether race should matter when it comes to love. Black men in Britain marry outside their race far more than white and Asian men, but black women are statistically more likely than black men to be in same-race relationships. To find out more, some of the group head off for a night out at a diverse dating event in the West Midlands to meet other single people dealing with the same dilemma.Last to reveal her story is 34-year-old property and litigation contractor Lin with an extremely personal experience that is born from her mixed heritage. 1.2 million people in the UK are mixed-race, and the numbers are growing. Lin's experience of racism from both sides of her extended family has led her to question where mixed race people fit in when it comes to being black. It strikes a chord with many in the group, raising fundamental questions about what it means to be black."

At the centre of this great sea, and surrounded by crystal clear waters, is Simon's first stop, the beautiful island of Malta. Driven by a surge of tourists, modern-day Malta is booming. But beneath the picture-postcard image lies a country accused of being a haven for money laundering and organised crime, where journalists can be murdered by car bombs.When Simon takes a ferry to his next destination, Calabria in southern Italy, he discovers a region in the grip of Europe's most powerful mafia, the 'Ndrangheta. With rare access to police and customs investigators, Simon follows an armed convoy carrying a ton of seized cocaine, joins a stakeout of a high-level suspect, and crawls through a huge underground warren of tunnels and bunkers built by fugitive mafia bosses. Travelling east along the southern tip of mainland Italy, Simon visits a turtle conservation centre, meeting Raoul, a loggerhead turtle rescued after swallowing huge quantities of plastic, a massive and increasing threat to Mediterranean wildlife. Simon helps release him back into the sea. Taking the overnight ferry from the heel of Italy, Simon arrives in one of the least-known but most beautiful corners of the Mediterranean, Albania. Under communist rule, Albania was isolated and shut off from most of the world. In a country now hoping for EU membership, Simon discovers an ancient culture of vendetta, where if an adult commits a crime, a child can be killed in revenge. Simon ends the first leg of his journey at a spectacular wildlife reserve where bird life is now recovering following the country's groundbreaking ban on hunting."

Yet with so little of it available, and often only briefly, the challenge for most individuals is how to overcome intense competition when your rivals are just as dependent on the precious freshwater for their success. Whether it is from melting ice, torrential rain or shrinking wetlands, the cycle of freshwater is the trigger for spectacular mating rituals and fierce combat.The start of the rains in South Africa triggers a violent battle between male giant African bullfrogs. Rare hooded grebes in Patagonia perform one of natureâs more comical dances to seduce their partner, and a male cichlid fish builds a home for his harem from old snail shells, but a sneaky dwarf has the last laugh there.The mating season for animals that live in freshwater is often determined by when is best for their new offspring - even if that moment is far from ideal for the parents. In the wetlands of Zambia, female lechwe antelope search for the strongest males while contending with drought, and in the Pantanal of Brazil at the end of the dry season, caimans congregate in huge numbers around the last remaining water to perform their spectacular displays.For all those dependent on the cycle of freshwater to breed, timing is everything."

Now, fuelled by websites and social media, a new economy has emerged â bringing a world of transactional sex to people who might never have previously considered it.  Bafta Award-winning film-maker Louis Theroux returns to the UK to meet women legally providing sexual services, either to make a living or to supplement their income, potentially earning hundreds of pounds per hour. But rather than on the streets or in illegal brothels, these women sell sex from their own homes or hotels, utilising technology to share photos, make bookings and vet potential clients - making the exchange more accessible and, according to some, safer than the illegal alternatives.  The age-old issue of whether sex should ever be traded remains, with many believing it to be exploitative and damaging, driven by a society still shaped by the desires of men. Yet there are those who feel that selling sex can be a valid, empowering choice for those who choose to engage in it. As Louis meets the women and men participating in the new sexual economy, he explores whether selling sex can ever be a healthy way to make money."

That force is us. Humans are changing our planet so rapidly, itâs affecting earthâs life support systems: our weather, our oceans and the living world. To understand what is going wrong, we must look to the past. Earth has been through at least five mass extinction events, most of which have been caused by cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. Itâs not the lava or ash that wiped out life, but an invisible gas released by volcanoes: carbon dioxide. Through compelling animal-led stories and expert interviews, we discover how CO2 is destabilising our planet. We meet rescued orphaned elephants in Kenya, victims of ever worsening droughts, and join ocean patrols off the coast of Gabon fighting to save endangered sharks. In the Amazon, we witness wildlife teams saving animals in the shrinking forests, and in San Diego we enter a cryogenic zoo preserving the DNA of endangered species before they become extinct. Almost every part of modern life depends on energy created by burning fossil fuels, and this produces CO2 in huge amounts. Humans are now acting like a super-volcano, releasing carbon dioxide at an even greater rate than the prehistoric mega-eruptions that extinguished life in the past. Globally, we now release 100 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of Earth's volcanoes combined.The greatest change to be made is in how we create energy, and the planet is brimming with natural power that can help us do just that. Itâs these forces of nature - the wind, the sun, waves and geothermal energy - that hold the key to our future."

But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares. All around the world, immense waves pound the shore, and this episode reveals some of the largest on the planet, over 30 metres high. Over millennia these forces carve exquisite coastal sculptures and cliffs that are home to huge colonies of seabirds. Puffins fly up to 30 miles out to sea to find food for their chicks. A father returns with one precious beakful of food... then pirates attack. Desperate dads must escape the faster and more aerobatic skuas before finally delivering a meal to their young puffling.Meanwhile, in the remote Pacific islands lives the most terrestrial fish on the planet. It lives in miniature caves above the tide lines and uses its tail like a coiled spring to jump from rock to rock. A male tries to attract a mate, but waves are a constant hindrance. These are fish that seem to hate water!Once a year, king penguins return to the cold Antarctic shores of South Georgia for a month-long moult. First they must cross the biggest wall of blubber on the planet - thousands of gigantic elephant seals. Then they face a month with no food, before they can return to their natural home, the chilly Antarctic seas. The planet's coasts are changing fast as they are among the most built-up areas of the world. Just off the beaches of Miami, the largest gathering of coastal sharks on the planet can still be found. But today they must face the many challenges that come from our world too."

Simon Schama explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world, looking at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity.","Simon Schama begins Civilisations with this premise: that it is in art - the play of the creative imagination - that humanity expresses its most essential self: the power to break the tyranny of the humdrum, the grind of everyday. Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?Using the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit."

Pressure rises on all sides, not only to deliver medals, but to win Londonâs Olympic bid.","After the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Britain failed to move up from tenth position in the medal table at the Athens games in 2004. Increasingly reliant on a generation of ageing champions, it was time for our younger hopes to step up and deliver. And to ensure that funding delivered results, UK Sport introduced a no compromise approach, meaning that all funded athletes needed to start winning medals.The pressure was on for youngster Tom Daley to step up to the big time, but as a nine-year-old away from home, it was the nights alone that were the hardest. Christine Ohuruogu, the potential face of the 2012 games, describes her dramatic fall from grace after missing three drugs tests, and her subsequent return to the track. And after no male gymnasts were even fielded in Athens, Louis Smith became the first British man to win an individual gymnastics medal in a hundred years at the Beijing games in 2008. His win finally achieved funding for his beloved sport.  With a haul of 51 medals achieved at the epic Beijing games, Britain was finally showing its mettle, but could we continue to fund sport at the increasing rates needed, and would we succumb to the critics and embarrass ourselves on home turf four years later?"

A deeply disturbing pattern of psychological manipulation and sexual grooming begins to emerge.Higgins was the subject of a police investigation in the early 1990s, but the subsequent trial resulted in acquittal. Barry Bennell was first convicted in Florida in 1995. He and Higgins were the subject of a Dispatches documentary back in 1997, for which Dean Radford and Ian Ackley bravely waived their anonymity in order to discuss what had happened to them then. And yet the response to the Dispatches programme was deafening silence. How was it that, after such public scrutiny, the true scale of the offending was able to remain hidden? Back in the present day, a new investigation into Higgins comes to a head. Dean hopes and prays that, 30 years on, history wonât repeat itself."

But it was the antics of the unpredictable Ulstersman and snooker genius, Higgins, that took the game stratospheric.Raw and unpredictable on the table, outspoken and badly behaved off it, Higgins declared war on the 1970s snooker establishment, entering into a years-long rivalry with the man who more than anyone embodied the old guard, ex-policeman Ray Reardon. Higgins and Reardon didnât see eye to eye, but it was well known that Higgins could start a fight in an empty room. As the 70s wore on, the tabloids gleefully reported on a string of on- and off-the-table misdeeds.Almost inevitably, Reardon and Higgins eventually came face to face in the World Championship final of 1982, in what was by far the biggest tournament to date. The clash of the two snooker titans - the paragon of the establishment against the self-described âPeopleâs Championâ - would be the match that redefined the British publicâs relationship with the sport and set the course for a decade where it would become box office gold."

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer. In We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UKâs most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. Itâs never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but itâs a question theyâll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.   Because instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and todayâs top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team â itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been â and many of the countryâs biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the âcagesâ of the UKâs estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.   So if theyâre going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, itâs these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Evertonâs Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villaâs Tyrone Mings and West Hamâs Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St Georgeâs Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients heâd like to see making it into the final song."

In 1976, Caitlyn â then known as Bruce â won Decathlon gold at the Montreal Olympics. She was called 'the world's greatest athlete'. Fame and adulation followed, but gender dysphoria â where there's a mismatch between someone's biological sex and their gender identity â was always bubbling away under the surface. In 2015, Caitlyn finally came out as a transgender woman. In this programme, Simon Mundie and Caitlyn discuss some of the lessons she has learnt during her incredible life. They talk about the importance of honesty and being true to yourself and your family around you, and about not judging a book by its cover, as someone who apparently has it all may well be suffering inside. Itâs all about the challenges you overcome, not the heights you attain.
