Coasts are the most dynamic and challenging habitats in the ocean - that brings great rewards but also great danger. The extraordinary animals that live here must find ingenious ways to cope with two very different worlds.This episode is a rollercoaster ride of heart-stopping action and epic drama, peopled with characters from the beautiful to the bizarre. We meet fish that live on dry land and puffins that must travel 60 miles or more for a single meal, and witness a life-and-death struggle in a technicolour rock pool.In a secluded cove in the Galapagos, sea lions feast on 60kg tuna. It should be impossible - tuna are usually far too fast for sea lions to catch. But here the sea lions club together to herd their prey inshore. Once trapped in the shallows, these huge fish are easy pickings.As the tide recedes in Brazil, lightfoot crabs leap from rock to rock, desperately avoiding the water - their lives depend on it. Moray eels launch themselves from rock pools, jaw gaping. Then octopuses, too. Both crawl across dry rock to set their ambush. Elsewhere, the ever-changing tides create rock pools. But these temporary worlds are a battleground. Predatory starfish turn a magical garden into the stuff of nightmares. All around the world, immense waves pound the shore, and this episode reveals some of the largest on the planet, over 30 metres high. Over millennia these forces carve exquisite coastal sculptures and cliffs that are home to huge colonies of seabirds. Puffins fly up to 30 miles out to sea to find food for their chicks. A father returns with one precious beakful of food... then pirates attack. Desperate dads must escape the faster and more aerobatic skuas before finally delivering a meal to their young puffling.Meanwhile, in the remote Pacific islands lives the most terrestrial fish on the planet. It lives in miniature caves above the tide lines and uses its tail like a coiled spring to jump from rock to rock. A male tries to attract a mate, but waves are a constant hindrance. These are fish that seem to hate water!Once a year, king penguins return to the cold Antarctic shores of South Georgia for a month-long moult. First they must cross the biggest wall of blubber on the planet - thousands of gigantic elephant seals. Then they face a month with no food, before they can return to their natural home, the chilly Antarctic seas. The planet's coasts are changing fast as they are among the most built-up areas of the world. Just off the beaches of Miami, the largest gathering of coastal sharks on the planet can still be found. But today they must face the many challenges that come from our world too.","coast, two world collide. coast dynamic challenging habitat ocean- brings great reward also great danger. extraordinary animal live must find ingenious way cope two different worlds.this episode rollercoaster ride heart-stopping action epic drama, peopled character beautiful bizarre. meet fish live dry land puffin must travel 60 mile single meal, witness life-and-death struggle technicolour rock pool.in secluded cove galapagos, sea lion feast 60kg tuna. impossible- tuna usually far fast sea lion catch. sea lion club together herd prey inshore. trapped shallow, huge fish easy pickings.as tide recedes brazil, lightfoot crab leap rock rock, desperately avoiding water- life depend. moray eel launch rock pool, jaw gaping. octopus,. crawl across dry rock set ambush. elsewhere, ever-changing tide create rock pool. temporary world battleground. predatory starfish turn magical garden stuff nightmare. around world, immense wave pound shore, episode reveals largest planet, 30 metre high. millennium force carve exquisite coastal sculpture cliff home huge colony seabird. puffin fly 30 mile sea find food chick. father return one precious beakful food... pirate attack. desperate dad must escape faster aerobatic skua finally delivering meal young puffling.meanwhile, remote pacific island life terrestrial fish planet. life miniature cave tide line us tail like coiled spring jump rock rock. male try attract mate, wave constant hindrance. fish seem hate water! year, king penguin return cold antarctic shore south georgia month-long moult. first must cross biggest wall blubber planet- thousand gigantic elephant seal. face month food, return natural home, chilly antarctic sea. planet 's coast changing fast among built-up area world. beach miami, largest gathering coastal shark planet still found. today must face many challenge come world.",-0.0,-0.0,1.0,0.69492,0.74371,0.79129,0.83772,0.9867008250528408,0.12166055634722314,1.0,0.6113300881462678,0.8704433627154226

Art makes life worth living and is the great window into human potential. And societies become civilised to the extent that they take culture as seriously as the prosecution of power or the accumulation of wealth. But in the century of total war and industrial slaughter, was (and is) that enough? The cause of humanity went up in the smoke of the Nazi crematoria. Horror and terror brushed beauty aside and stamped on its pretensions. In the modern world, art has become increasingly commodified. Simon's last programme explores the fate of art in the machine- and profit-driven world. It looks at the rise of art as a tradeable commodity and turns on one central question. Should art create a realm separate from the modern world, a place where we can escape and pull the ladder up after us? Or should it plunge headlong into the chaos and cacophony while transforming the way we see it and live in it?Using the works of both dead and contemporary artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Simon seeks answers to these profound questions. His conclusion is imbued with hope: despite all the travails of the present, by engaging with the here-and-now, art still offers civilisation an insight into the incomprehensibility of the world and a way to transcend its horrors with the enduring creativity of the human spirit.","simon schama begin civilisation premise: art- play creative imagination- humanity express essential self: power break tyranny humdrum, grind everyday. art make life worth living great window human potential. society become civilised extent take culture seriously prosecution power accumulation wealth. century total war industrial slaughter,() enough? cause humanity went smoke nazi crematorium. horror terror brushed beauty aside stamped pretension. modern world, art become increasingly commodified. simon 's last programme explores fate art machine- profit-driven world. look rise art tradeable commodity turn one central question. art create realm separate modern world, place escape pull ladder u? plunge headlong chaos cacophony transforming way see live? using work dead contemporary artist 20th 21st century, simon seek answer profound question. conclusion imbued hope: despite travail present, engaging here-and-now, art still offer civilisation insight incomprehensibility world way transcend horror enduring creativity human spirit.",-0.029197080291970802,-0.2,0.21,0.42670043795620444,0.4820103649635037,0.5764002919708029,0.6704302189781022,0.9877147672030193,0.02675023499554013,0.2198759877375055,0.6694570498479777,0.36973634177432957

To understand what is going wrong, we must look to the past. Earth has been through at least five mass extinction events, most of which have been caused by cataclysmic volcanic eruptions. It’s not the lava or ash that wiped out life, but an invisible gas released by volcanoes: carbon dioxide. Through compelling animal-led stories and expert interviews, we discover how CO2 is destabilising our planet. We meet rescued orphaned elephants in Kenya, victims of ever worsening droughts, and join ocean patrols off the coast of Gabon fighting to save endangered sharks. In the Amazon, we witness wildlife teams saving animals in the shrinking forests, and in San Diego we enter a cryogenic zoo preserving the DNA of endangered species before they become extinct. Almost every part of modern life depends on energy created by burning fossil fuels, and this produces CO2 in huge amounts. Humans are now acting like a super-volcano, releasing carbon dioxide at an even greater rate than the prehistoric mega-eruptions that extinguished life in the past. Globally, we now release 100 times more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than all of Earth's volcanoes combined.The greatest change to be made is in how we create energy, and the planet is brimming with natural power that can help us do just that.

Bashar al-Assad trained to be an eye doctor at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington and Asma was a British-born girl from a Syrian family with a career in investment banking. Over a decade ago, they were being welcomed with open arms in Britain. Today, they are entrenched in a brutal war that has led to some of the most horrifying crimes of modern times. Told through rarely seen footage and testimony of those who knew them, worked with them and studied them, the series explores how the couple, who at first were seen as a modernising force, ended up running a regime accused of war crimes.In episode two, Bashar Assad is now president of Syria. His glamorous wife Asma is now first lady. Both are faced with a number of problems. Asma's in-laws don't like the idea of her being first lady and want to keep her out of the limelight. An angry president of the United States names Syria as part of the axis of evil and the United Nations issue resolutions that Bashar's family want him to ignore. The Assads soon find themselves at the centre of a murder investigation, as one of their political enemies is blown up in a car bomb.

Now, fuelled by websites and social media, a new economy has emerged – bringing a world of transactional sex to people who might never have previously considered it.  Bafta Award-winning film-maker Louis Theroux returns to the UK to meet women legally providing sexual services, either to make a living or to supplement their income, potentially earning hundreds of pounds per hour. But rather than on the streets or in illegal brothels, these women sell sex from their own homes or hotels, utilising technology to share photos, make bookings and vet potential clients - making the exchange more accessible and, according to some, safer than the illegal alternatives.

Rare hooded grebes in Patagonia perform one of nature’s more comical dances to seduce their partner, and a male cichlid fish builds a home for his harem from old snail shells, but a sneaky dwarf has the last laugh there.The mating season for animals that live in freshwater is often determined by when is best for their new offspring - even if that moment is far from ideal for the parents. In the wetlands of Zambia, female lechwe antelope search for the strongest males while contending with drought, and in the Pantanal of Brazil at the end of the dry season, caimans congregate in huge numbers around the last remaining water to perform their spectacular displays.For all those dependent on the cycle of freshwater to breed, timing is everything.","freshwater cover tiny fraction earth ’ surface, vital meeting place many animal- stage million gather find mate. yet little available, often briefly, challenge individual overcome intense competition rival dependent precious freshwater success. whether melting ice, torrential rain shrinking wetland, cycle freshwater trigger spectacular mating ritual fierce combat.the start rain south africa trigger violent battle male giant african bullfrog. rare hooded grebe patagonia perform one nature ’ comical dance seduce partner, male cichlid fish build home harem old snail shell, sneaky dwarf last laugh there.the mating season animal live freshwater often determined best new offspring- even moment far ideal parent. wetland zambia, female lechwe antelope search strongest male contending drought, pantanal brazil end dry season, caiman congregate huge number around last remaining water perform spectacular displays.for dependent cycle freshwater breed, timing everything.",-0.0,-0.0,0.71,0.61188,0.661665,0.725735,0.789655,0.9840378297003398,0.0,0.0,0.4586667149553847,0.15288890498512822

They grapple with tough, unsettling and emotional questions about being black and British in search of a way forward. Each of them has a deeply personal story to share about an event that proved to be a seismic moment in their life. They confront their differences, hoping to find answers from each other and from those who are trying to change Britain.The most radical of the group, university professor Kehinde, set up Britain's first black studies degree. He believes it's time for a fundamental change to Britain. He has a revolutionary idea to reveal to the group which could prove divisive - black-only workplaces. Although recent years have seen black leaders taking the top jobs at some big companies, at the latest count, there wasn't a single black CEO in a FTSE 100 company. At the other end of the pay scale, however, black people are overrepresented in lower-paying jobs. The group meet someone who won one of the UK's biggest race discrimination payouts in recent years and debate whether taking companies to task or race-based quotas could be the way forward. One of the panel from last year's controversial race commission report also drops in to discuss whether or not racism is still the most significant barrier holding back progression for black people in Britain.29-year-old NHS doctor Raphel has matters of the heart on his mind.  He's at a stage in life where he's looking to settle down and feeling the pressure to marry within the black community, so he wants to ask the group whether race should matter when it comes to love. Black men in Britain marry outside their race far more than white and Asian men, but black women are statistically more likely than black men to be in same-race relationships. To find out more, some of the group head off for a night out at a diverse dating event in the West Midlands to meet other single people dealing with the same dilemma.Last to reveal her story is 34-year-old property and litigation contractor Lin with an extremely personal experience that is born from her mixed heritage. 1.2 million people in the UK are mixed-race, and the numbers are growing. Lin's experience of racism from both sides of her extended family has led her to question where mixed race people fit in when it comes to being black. It strikes a chord with many in the group, raising fundamental questions about what it means to be black.","six black briton different background viewpoint coming together one roof time race racism uk sparked nationwide discussion need change. grapple tough, unsettling emotional question black british search way forward. deeply personal story share event proved seismic moment life. confront difference, hoping find answer trying change britain.the radical group, university professor kehinde, set britain 's first black study degree. belief 's time fundamental change britain. revolutionary idea reveal group could prove divisive- black-only workplace. although recent year seen black leader taking top job big company, latest count, n't single black ceo ftse 100 company. end pay scale, however, black people overrepresented lower-paying job. group meet someone one uk 's biggest race discrimination payouts recent year debate whether taking company task race-based quota could way forward. one panel last year 's controversial race commission report also drop discus whether racism still significant barrier holding back progression black people britain.29-year-old nh doctor raphel matter heart mind.

Can these chefs hold their nerve and deliver a perfectly prepared duck dish of their own creation alongside a great quality sauce, or will they buckle under the pressure?Next, the six chefs have a chance to redeem any earlier mistakes when they cook their own Signature Dish for Monica, Marcus and Gregg.
