Pressure rises on all sides, not only to deliver medals, but to win London’s Olympic bid.;After the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Britain failed to move up from tenth position in the medal table at the Athens games in 2004. Increasingly reliant on a generation of ageing champions, it was time for our younger hopes to step up and deliver. And to ensure that funding delivered results, UK Sport introduced a no compromise approach, meaning that all funded athletes needed to start winning medals.The pressure was on for youngster Tom Daley to step up to the big time, but as a nine-year-old away from home, it was the nights alone that were the hardest. Christine Ohuruogu, the potential face of the 2012 games, describes her dramatic fall from grace after missing three drugs tests, and her subsequent return to the track. And after no male gymnasts were even fielded in Athens, Louis Smith became the first British man to win an individual gymnastics medal in a hundred years at the Beijing games in 2008. His win finally achieved funding for his beloved sport.  With a haul of 51 medals achieved at the epic Beijing games, Britain was finally showing its mettle, but could we continue to fund sport at the increasing rates needed, and would we succumb to the critics and embarrass ourselves on home turf four years later?

It follows the investigation into former Southampton youth coach Bob Higgins, filming alongside Hampshire Police detectives as they conduct interviews with Higgins and the survivors. A deeply disturbing pattern of psychological manipulation and sexual grooming begins to emerge.Higgins was the subject of a police investigation in the early 1990s, but the subsequent trial resulted in acquittal. Barry Bennell was first convicted in Florida in 1995. He and Higgins were the subject of a Dispatches documentary back in 1997, for which Dean Radford and Ian Ackley bravely waived their anonymity in order to discuss what had happened to them then. And yet the response to the Dispatches programme was deafening silence. How was it that, after such public scrutiny, the true scale of the offending was able to remain hidden? Back in the present day, a new investigation into Higgins comes to a head. Dean hopes and prays that, 30 years on, history won’t repeat itself.

But it was the antics of the unpredictable Ulstersman and snooker genius, Higgins, that took the game stratospheric.Raw and unpredictable on the table, outspoken and badly behaved off it, Higgins declared war on the 1970s snooker establishment, entering into a years-long rivalry with the man who more than anyone embodied the old guard, ex-policeman Ray Reardon. Higgins and Reardon didn’t see eye to eye, but it was well known that Higgins could start a fight in an empty room. As the 70s wore on, the tabloids gleefully reported on a string of on- and off-the-table misdeeds.Almost inevitably, Reardon and Higgins eventually came face to face in the World Championship final of 1982, in what was by far the biggest tournament to date. The clash of the two snooker titans - the paragon of the establishment against the self-described ‘People’s Champion’ - would be the match that redefined the British public’s relationship with the sport and set the course for a decade where it would become box office gold.

And, with the final on 11 July taking place on the hallowed turf of Wembley, football really is coming home this summer. In We Are England, Krept and Konan, two of the UK’s most talented and successful rap artists, are setting out to mark what is sure to be a huge shared cultural moment by making a track to celebrate the England football team. But first they need to investigate what Englishness actually means in 2021. It’s never been a simple question for those of non-white British heritage, but it’s a question they’ll need to tackle if they are going to create an authentic track to celebrate the national squad.   Because instead of the traditional cheesy sing-along, featuring a former soap actor or long-retired left-back, Krept and Konan are going to create an anthem for our times: representing the modern diversity and forward-looking culture in which our chart-topping rap stars and the young stars of the England team are cut from the same cloth. Rap culture is the culture of young Britain, and today’s top-tier teams now move to a whole different beat than they did when the Three Lions anthem of Euros 96 had them tapping their toes in the changing rooms and their fans chanting on the terraces. The lifestyle, attitude, slang and swagger of rap culture is replicated in the national football team – itself now one of the youngest and most diverse it has ever been – and many of the country’s biggest rappers came up honing their football skills and their rap lyrics on our city streets and in the ‘cages’ of the UK’s estates, just as top footballers grew up surrounded by hip hop culture, looking up to rap stars.   So if they’re going to create a track to celebrate the pride of a new nation, it’s these stories that Krept and Konan want to tell, and this bold, aspirational culture they want to reflect. On their journey into exploring national identity, they hit the road, striking out beyond the streets of the capital as they get to know the England squad, meeting players including Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Aston Villa’s Tyrone Mings and West Ham’s Declan Rice as well as retired Lioness legend, Eni Aluko. They also seek advice from fellow artists including chart-topping Manchester rapper Aitch who they meet at Old Trafford, and west London rapper Big Zuu as they watch some football anthems from days gone by to see just how much our national culture has changed. They also go to St George’s Park, home of the England team, where they get an exclusive audience with England manager Gareth Southgate to find out what ingredients he’d like to see making it into the final song.

In 1976, Caitlyn – then known as Bruce – won Decathlon gold at the Montreal Olympics. She was called 'the world's greatest athlete'. Fame and adulation followed, but gender dysphoria – where there's a mismatch between someone's biological sex and their gender identity – was always bubbling away under the surface. In 2015, Caitlyn finally came out as a transgender woman. In this programme, Simon Mundie and Caitlyn discuss some of the lessons she has learnt during her incredible life. They talk about the importance of honesty and being true to yourself and your family around you, and about not judging a book by its cover, as someone who apparently has it all may well be suffering inside. It’s all about the challenges you overcome, not the heights you attain.
